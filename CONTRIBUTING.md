# Welcome

Thank you very kindly for your interest in Nerium! We would love to get pull requests from everyone to help this project along. ðŸ™‚

Areas of special interest include expanding test coverage, adding more query types and formatters to [`contrib`](https://github.com/OAODEV/nerium/tree/master/nerium/contrib), improving the configuration mechanisms, and reports or fixes for any [issues](https://github.com/OAODEV/nerium/issues) you may come across.

## Guidelines

Although we at OAO have been able to use Nerium for Production work, this is very much a project in its early stages, and there isn't a lot here. With a few exceptions we generally use [`yapf`](https://pypi.org/project/yapf/) and [`isort`](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) to format our Python code, and in any case expect/prefer things to pass [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) linting.

Tests are good, and as noted above this project could use more of them.

Thanks again for your consideration.
