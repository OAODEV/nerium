# Welcome

Thank you very kindly for your interest in Nerium! We would love to get pull requests from everyone to help this project along. ðŸ™‚

## Guidelines

With a few exceptions we generally use [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/) and [`isort`](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) to format our Python code, and in any case expect/prefer things to pass [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) linting.

Tests are good, and any pull requests will be expected to include them.

Thanks again for your consideration.
